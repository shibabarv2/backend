### This is the official repo for shiba.bar's Golang backend.
**Why did I make this**? I made this because Roundcube didn't have the features I needed, so I decided to make my own. This backend was a fun learning experience and I will continue to update it when I get ideas.

## THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE ACTUALLY USED BY ANYONE BUT ME
You can if you want to.
